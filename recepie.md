1 Fry the tortillas: In a large saut√© pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high. When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, fry until golden brown.

Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.

Wipe pan clean of any browned bits of tortillas.

2 Heat the salsa: Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa cook for several minutes. If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa.

3 Add fried tortillas to the salsa: Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla until they are all well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more.
